# Building blocks
Building blocks are the fundamental components of any programming language, providing the basic building blocks for creating complex software applications. In Hurx, there are several building blocks that developers can use to create their programs, including `classes`, `interfaces`, `enums`, and `types`.

### [Classes](classes/index.md)
Classes are the backbone of object-oriented programming in Hurx, providing a blueprint for creating objects that can interact with one another. They define the properties and behaviors of objects, and can be used to encapsulate complex logic and data structures. In Hurx, classes are created using the `class` keyword and can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.

### [Interfaces](interfaces/index.md)
Interfaces are another important building block in Hurx, providing a contract for defining the behavior of objects without defining their implementation. They define a set of methods and properties that objects must implement, and can be used to enforce consistency and standardization in codebases. In Hurx, interfaces are created using the `interface` keyword and can be implemented by classes and other interfaces.

### [Enums](enums/index.md)
Enums are a specialized type of data structure in Hurx that allow developers to define a set of named values. They are commonly used to represent a set of options or states, and can be used to improve code readability and maintainability. In Hurx, enums are created using the `enum` keyword and can have associated values and methods.

### [Types](types/index.md)
Finally, types are the foundation of data structures in Hurx, providing a way to define the shape and behavior of data. They can be used to define variables, function arguments, and return types, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of a program. In Hurx, types are created using the `type` keyword and can be composed of other types and data structures.
